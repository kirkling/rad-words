## Captions from [A Softer World comic](http://www.asofterworld.com/archive.php)

+ I have found a way to watch video in your head. High definition, with instant replay. It is called having regrets.

+ Maybe next year is the year, maybe last year.

+ We need more good crazy. It'd be nice to watch the news, and think, 'that's fucking insane', but feel a little jealous instead of just alone.

+ Every statue in town came to life, but they'd been watching long enough to know better than to ever move.

+ I don't know if your wings are real, but I've never seen you without them, and I follow you everywhere.

+ I had all kinds of plans in case of a zombie attack. I just figured I'd be on the other side.

+ If at first you don't succeed...run.

+ Tell me your heart doesn't race for a hurricane or a burning building.

+ Remember when your potential was a promise instead of a regret?

+ Before we teach computers to love maybe we should teach them about personal boundaries

+ Our bodies are ours to break, ours to throw into rivers, ours to light on fire, ours to launch into the depths of space

+ Being in love is totally punk rock.

+ What kind of person talks trash during a chess game?

+ I'm married to the sea/ but don't tell her I called her that

+ I have super powers and a costume/ every night I panic just outside my door/ but every night I try again

+ I sing anyway.
